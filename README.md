GraduateAssistantshipProject
============================

This project was part of the Graduate Reseearch Assistantship (GA) which is offered on the basis of scholastic accomplishments and competence. I was able to clear the written test and reached till the final round. This project was developed in the time constraint of 2 days only. The basic requirement was to develop a platforn for the students to let them apply for a scholarship. It was also required to build the functionalities of creating the super user, department users and their roles. I was able to develop almost 80% of the requirements in the given timline using .NET 3.5 and Visual Studio 2012.

For Login, there are only two profiles set as of now:
1.
User Name: sadmin
Password: sadmin

2.
User Name: csadmin
Password: csadmin

When you login using "sadmin" i.e. system administrator, you can see other user's profile and the submitted applications from the student. I am able to create new user in the system but I can not download resume/recommendations in the students' applicationsas of now due to partial implementation.

When you login using "csadmin" i.e. department user, you will not see anything here as I didn't implement this part. Department user is only supposed to see the submitted applications related to his/her own department and modify them.
