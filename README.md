GraduateAssistantshipProject
============================

This project was part of the Graduate Reseearch Assistantship (GA) which is offered on the basis of scholastic accomplishments and competence. I was able to clear the written test and reached till the final round. This project was developed in the time constraint of 2 days only. The basic requirement was to develop a platforn for the students to let them apply for a scholarship. It was also required to build the functionalities of creating the super user, department users and their roles. I was able to develop almost 80% of the requirements in the given timline.
